# LINEAR REGRESSION ESTIMATES FROM MATRIX ALGEBRA USING R

```{r}
# Reading in X and Y variables: 
expl.var <- c(16 , 16 , 16 , 16 , 24,  24,  24 , 24,  32 , 32 , 32 , 32 , 40 , 40,  40 , 40) 
resp.var <- c(199, 205, 196, 200, 218, 220, 215, 223, 237, 234, 235, 230, 250,  248, 253,  246) 
```

# Setting up design matrix: 

```{r}
n <- length(resp.var)           # n = SAMPLE SIZE. Use length function to return #                                 of variables in vector/list resp.var 

Y <- resp.var   # Renaming resp.var so it's consistent with traditional        
                # representation of response variable: Y. 

X <- cbind(1,expl.var)          # DESIGN MATRIX (FIRST COLUMN HAS ONLY ONES)
                                # In a design matrix X has 1s in the first columns 
                                # and the explanatory variables in the second                                      # column. Cbind combines a column of 1s w/ a column                                 equal to the # of rows of expl.var. The result is a                                 design matrix with rows of: [1 explanatory                                         variable] 

dimnames(X) <- list(NULL,NULL)  # dimnames: NOT REQ'D BUT HELPFUL FOR PRINTING
print(t(X))
p <- ncol(X)                    # p = NUMBER OF PARAMETERS ESTIMATED
```

# Performing initial matrix operations: 

```{r}
XTX <- t(X) %*% X               # X'X MATRIX: t(X)=X' (this transposes X)  
                                # %*%=MATRIX MULTIPLICATION
print(XTX)

XTX.INV <- solve(XTX)           # INVERSE OF X'X

print(XTX %*% XTX.INV)          # THIS SHOULD YIELD IDENTITY MATRIX
```

# Calculating matrix outputs: 

```{r}
b <- XTX.INV %*% t(X) %*% Y     # ESTIMATED PARAMETERS, created by fist multiplying the inverse vector ofx by the transposed x, and then multiplying by vector of Y. 
print(b)

H <- X %*% XTX.INV %*% t(X)     # HAT MATRIX, created by multiplying X 

Y.hat <- H %*% Y                # FITTED VALUES, created by multiplying HAT MATRIX by vector Y 
print(t(Y.hat))

RESID <- Y - Y.hat              # RESIDUAL VALUES, created by subtracting predicted Y values from expected 
print(t(RESID))

SSE <- t(RESID) %*% RESID       # SUM OF SQUARED ERRORS, SSE found by taking the transpose of the residual vectors and multiplying by the residual vectors 
print(SSE)

MSE <- as.numeric(SSE/(n-p))    # MEAN SQUARE ERROR: as.numeric MAKES MSE A SCALAR,
                                # NEEDED FOR VAR.COV BELOW
                    
print(MSE)

RMSE <- sqrt(MSE)     
print(RMSE)

VAR.COV <- MSE*(XTX.INV)        # VAR/COVAR MATRIX, created by multiplying MSE by the inverse of X'X 
print(VAR.COV)

se.b0 <- sqrt(VAR.COV[1,1])     # STANDARD ERROR b_0: Use row=1, col=1 of VAR.COV
se.b1 <- sqrt(VAR.COV[2,2])     # STANDARD ERROR b_1: Use row=2, col=2 of VAR.COV

print(cbind(se.b0, se.b1))

# Checked Minitab output to confirm
